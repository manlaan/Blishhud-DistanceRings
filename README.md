Recommended to use pre-release of Blish-HUD for this module.  (higher than 0.7.0)

While it does work with previous versions, the new Graphic Settings to "Smooth Character Position" smooths the ring drawing quite a bit.   

Also, the 0.7.0 release has a bug with Manage Modules Settings panel with the scroll bar.   Cannot drag bar, and mouse wheel scrolls to end of settings.
